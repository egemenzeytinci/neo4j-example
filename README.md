## Description
In the present study, an example graph was created from e-commerce data using Neo4j, 
then customer segmentation was made with RFM analysis using this data.

First of all, you need to install Neo4j Community Edition on your local.
You can follow the instructions [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/) for this.

You can find the cypher statements needed to create a example graph in the 
*insert.cql* file under the *data* folder. 
In addition, the cypher statement that will get the rfm values from the graph is 
located in the *rfm.cql* file under the same folder.

Finally, all the required packages are in the jupyter notebook file.
